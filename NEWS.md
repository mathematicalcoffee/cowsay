## cowsay 1.2.0

* Improved print handling (e.g. of t-test results)

## cowsay 1.1.0

* Added 'rude' option to `list.cows` and `randomcowsay` (default `FALSE`) to
  avoid "rude" cows by default (e.g. 'sodomized', which is included in my system
  version of cowsay, but which some might find distasteful);
  `cowsayOptions('rude.cows')` lets you get/set such cows.
